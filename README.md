In this challenge, an interactive dashboard was created that showcases data from the Belly Button Biodiversity project (http://robdunnlab.com/projects/belly-button-biodiversity/). Data from this project is loacated in the data folder as samples.json.

This dashboard features a dropdown menu where users can select a sample number from the samples included in the data. Upon sample number selection, the following displays on the dashboard: A horizontal bar chart that displays the top 10 OTUs found in that individual, a panel that identifies the individual's demographic information as key-value pairs directly from the data, a bubble chart that displays each sample, and a gauge chart that displays the belly button washing frequency for the selected individual.
