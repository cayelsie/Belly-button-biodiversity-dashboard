In this challenge, an interactive dashboard was created that showcases data from the Belly Button Biodiversity project (http://robdunnlab.com/projects/belly-button-biodiversity/). Data from this project is loacated in the data folder as samples.json.

This dashboard features a dropdown menu where users can select a sample number from the samples included in the data. Upon sample number selection, the following displays on the dashboard: A horizontal bar chart that displays the top 10 OTUs found in that individual, a panel that identifies the individual's demographic information as key-value pairs directly from the data, a bubble chart that displays each sample, and a gauge chart that displays the belly button washing frequency for the selected individual. Javascript, D3 and Plotly were used in this challenge. The javascript file is in the static folder, in the js folder at app.js.
